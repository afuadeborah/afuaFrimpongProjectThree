Project 3 Pseudo Code

All of this will take place within a Document Ready:
    $(function(){
        All code goes here
    


Upon beginning quiz user will be prompted to enter a username into a text input. This will be stored until the end result.
    const userWaveName = $(.textInput).val('');

All 3 options for each question are an contained in a clickable ul li which is triggered by an 'click' event. Each aesthetic is stored in a variable. 
    let $('.li') = $aestheticOption;

The score of each aesthetic will be stored as a variable to be updated as each option is selected. This should go in an array/object to change into integers?
    let gothScore = 0;
    let vaporScore = 0;
    let retroScore = 0;


Using a nested conditional, each selection will trigger a boolean which will be true or false.
Each answer will be pushed into an array that will be used to tabulate a score at the end of the quiz.
ex:

Put this in a for in loop so that for each question it tracks the score.

   let score = $aestheticOption.on('click', function(e){
       e.preventDefault()
        if (gothAnswer === true) {

            gothScore = gothScore + 1;

        } else if (vaporAnswer === true) {

            vaporScore = vaporScore + 1;
        } else {
            
            retroScore = retroScore + 1;
        }
}

Each score will be pushed into an array that will be looped through and the score will be tabulated from this array using another conditional


To calculate the result:
    if(gothScore > vaporScore && gothScore > retroScore){

        console.log("${userName}, You are into the Goth Aesthetic.”);
        // Dynamic HTML here?


    } else if (vaporScore > gothScore && vaporScore > retroScore){

        console.log(`${userName}, You are into the VaporWave aesthetic`);
    } else {

        console.log(`${userName}, You are into Retro Aesthetic`)
    }





// Put in userWaveName in result and display 2 images template literal:
`<h2> ${userWaveName}, you are the ${}Wave aesthetic!</h2>`

});
//Doc Ready Scope

//Question Array
    //Each question has to randomize the order of the answers or else user will be able to guess their result before the end of the quiz
