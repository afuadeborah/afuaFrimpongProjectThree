Project 3 Pseudo Code

All of this will take place within a Document Ready:
    $(function(){
        All code goes here
    


Upon beginning quiz user will be prompted to enter a username into a text input. This will be stored until the end result.
    const userWaveName = $(.textInput).val('');

All 3 options for each question are an contained in a clickable ul li which is triggered by an 'click' event. Each aesthetic is stored in a variable. 
    const aestheticQuestion = $('.question);
    const grunge = $('.grungeSelection');
    const vapor = $('.vaporSelection');
    const pastel = $('.pastelSelection');

    //GLOBAL VARIABLES

The score of each aesthetic will be stored as a variable to be updated as each option is selected. This should go in an array/object to change into integers?
    let grungeScore = 0;
    let vaporScore = 0;
    let pastelScore = 0;




Using a nested conditional, each selection will trigger a boolean which will be true or false.
Each answer will be pushed into an array that will be used to tabulate a score at the end of the quiz.
ex:

Put this in a for in loop so that for each question it tracks the score.
this refers to any li so I need to refer to the li before using it
    
let score = aestheticQuestion.on('click', function(e){
e.preventDefault()

        if (grungeSelection === true) {

            grungeScore = grungeScore + 1;
            e.push()

        } else if (vaporSelection === true) {

            vaporScore = vaporScore + 1;
        } else {
            
            pastelScore = pastelScore + 1;
        }
}

Each score will be pushed into an array that will be looped through and the score will be tabulated from this array using another conditional




To calculate the result:
Loop through array
use .length
for (let selection in selectionContainer)
    if(grungeScore > vaporScore && grungeScore > pastelScore){

        console.log("${userName}, You are into the Grunge Aesthetic.”);
        // Dynamic HTML here?


    } else if (vaporScore > grungeScore && vaporScore > pastelScore){

        console.log(`${userName}, You are into the VaporWave aesthetic`);

    } else {

        console.log(`${userName}, You are into Pastel Aesthetic`)
    }





// Put in userWaveName in result and display 2 images template literal:
`<h2> ${userWaveName}, you are the ${} aesthetic!</h2>`

});
//Doc Ready Scope

console.log(quizQuestions[0].question);

nav into icons?
//Question Array
    //Each question has to randomize the order of the answers or else user will be able to guess their result before the end of the quiz
