Project 3 Pseudo Code

All of this will take place within a Document Ready:
    $(function(){
        All code goes here
    


Upon beginning quiz user will be prompted to enter a username into a text input. This will be stored until the end result.
    const userWaveName = $(.textInput).val('');

All 3 options for each question are an contained in a clickable ul li which is triggered by an 'click' event. Each aesthetic is stored in a variable. 
    const aestheticQuestion = $('.question);
    const grunge = $('.grungeSelection');
    const vapor = $('.vaporSelection');
    const pastel = $('.pastelSelection');

    //GLOBAL VARIABLES

The score of each aesthetic will be stored as a variable to be updated as each option is selected. This should go in an array/object to change into integers?
    let grungeScore = 0;
    let vaporScore = 0;
    let pastelScore = 0;




Using a nested conditional, each selection will trigger a boolean which will be true or false.
Each answer will be pushed into an array that will be used to tabulate a score at the end of the quiz.
ex:

Put this in a for in loop so that for each question it tracks the score.
this refers to any li so I need to refer to the li before using it
    
let score = aestheticQuestion.on('click', function(e){
e.preventDefault()

        if (grungeSelection === true) {

            grungeScore = grungeScore + 1;
            e.push()

        } else if (vaporSelection === true) {

            vaporScore = vaporScore + 1;
        } else {
            
            pastelScore = pastelScore + 1;
        }
}

Each score will be pushed into an array that will be looped through and the score will be tabulated from this array using another conditional




To calculate the result:
Loop through array
use .length
for (let selection in selectionContainer)
    if(grungeScore > vaporScore && grungeScore > pastelScore){

        console.log("${userName}, You are into the Grunge Aesthetic.”);
        // Dynamic HTML here?


    } else if (vaporScore > grungeScore && vaporScore > pastelScore){

        console.log(`${userName}, You are into the VaporWave aesthetic`);

    } else {

        console.log(`${userName}, You are into Pastel Aesthetic`)
    }





// Put in userWaveName in result and display 2 images template literal:
`<h2> ${userWaveName}, you are the ${} aesthetic!</h2>`

});
//Doc Ready Scope

console.log(quizQuestions[0].question);

nav into icons?
//Question Array
    //Each question has to randomize the order of the answers or else user will be able to guess their result before the end of the quiz

const quizQuestions = [
    {
    question1: 'What is question1?',
    options1: {
        a: VaporWave
        b: Grunge
        c: Pastel
        }
    },

    {
    question2: 'What is question2?',
    answer2: [
        {a: Grunge, 
        grungeSelection: true}
        {b: VaporWave, 
        vaporSelection: true}
        {c: Pastel, 
        pastelSelection = true}
        ]
    },

    {
    question3: 'What is question3?',
  
    answer3: {
        a: VaporWave
        b: Pastel
        c: Grunge
        }
    },
    
    {
    question4: 'What is question4?',
        answer4: {
        a: Pastel
        b: Grunge
        c: VaporWave
        }
    },

    {
    question5: 'What is question5?',
    answer5: {
        a: Grunge
        b: VaporWave
        c: Pastel
        }
    }

]

To get to each question
console.log(quizQuestions[i]);
    quizQuestions.forEach(function(option){
        console.log(`${option.question}`);
    })

maybe make 3 arrays for each aesthetic and push answers on click into their respective array and then loop through each array for size

or

loop through this array above and on click for each question push each answer into an empty array. at the end loop through each array and the biggest score (num1 num 2 example) will be logged into the result div using .html() method


        <div class="question question2">
            <ul class="selectionContainer">
                <li class="selection grungeSelection"></li>
                <li class="selection vaporSelection"></li>
                <li class="selection pastelSelection"></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question question3">
            <ul class="selectionContainer">
                <li class="selection vaporSelection"></li>
                <li class="selection pastelSelection"></li>
                <li class="selection grungeSelection"></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question question4">
            <ul class="selectionContainer">
                <li class="selection pastelSelection"></li>
                <li class="selection grungeSelection"></li>
                <li class="selection vaporSelection"></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question question5">
            <ul class="selectionContainer">
                <li class="selection grungeSelection"></li>
                <li class="selection vaporSelection"></li>
                <li class="selection pastelSelection"></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
